# C-Arduino-Exercises (Update README)
My work from EE108R (Computing for Engineers)

## Lab 1 (Grade 90%)
- [Lab1_3_BlinkDaughterboard](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-Arduino-Exercises/blob/master/Lab%201/Lab1_3_BlinkDaughterboard/Lab1_3_BlinkDaughterboard.ino): A modified blink program which blinks a daughterboardLED instead of an Arduino motherboard LED.

- [Question 4](https://github.com/ArturMK98/C-Arduino-Exercises/blob/master/Lab%201/Question4/Question4.ino): A program that prints the time in milliseconds (since the Arduino board was last reset) and the value of a global, static, and local variable to serial output, once every 2 seconds.

## Lab 2 (Grade 70%)
